@*<h1>Values and principles that guide us</h1>

    <h3>
        Ensuring access to quality healthcare comes with a lot of responsibility—towards both our doctor partners as well as our patients. We recognize and appreciate the trust placed in us by 1 lakh+ doctor partners and over 30 crore patients. This inspires us to do our best, and we continue to do everything we can to uphold it.

        Our guiding principles form the core of what we do and help us honour the trust and confidence reposed in us by our doctors and patients. Through these central tenets, we have been able to differentiate between the right and the wrong, every day.
